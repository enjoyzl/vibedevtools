# vibedevtools

A collection of Bash tools designed to boost development efficiency, continuously gathering handy automation scripts for the team.

## Directory Structure

- `bin/`: Directory for all executable tool scripts
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## Current Tools

- `pr-review.sh`: An intelligent PR review script that integrates GitHub CLI and Gemini AI, supporting multi-language and multi-type review, and automatically generates structured review reports.

## Usage

1. Enter the `bin/` directory and make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x bin/pr-review.sh
   ```
2. Run the tool:
   ```bash
   ./bin/pr-review.sh --help
   ```

## Future Plans

- Continuously add more useful tool scripts
- Provide one-click install scripts and detailed documentation
